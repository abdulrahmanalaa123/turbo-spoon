## Stateless vs stateful

- Discussing stateless vs stateful applications in his videos opened up some great topics
such as:

### Stateless and stateful is a loose term
- stateful means that the application stores state and whenever it loses said state it breaks.
- stateless means that the state is found in the request(at least mostly so) and it doesnt store any additional info.
- now this opens up several things imagine a stateful system that uses the database request for storing its persistent state is it considered stateless or stateful?
- the purist response would be you can call it stateful since it stores the state somewhere but the average response is call it whatever the heck you like you can call it a stateless service with a stateful system.

### stateless can be built on top of stateful and vice versa:
- There is a bunch of stateless and stateful protocols built upon stateless protocols as well
- DNS is built over UDP
- One example is quic which is stateful built upon UDP
- And another which ill go on a rant on is.
#### HTTP built over TCP
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview great link as well as the typical http session link
- Now HTTP is a stateless protocol which saves its state inside its cookies running over tcp where each http request is sent over a tcp connection tcp is actually a streaming protocol with each packet sent is given a segment giving it its state it needs to know the current segment we have.
- HTTP 1 used to just send 1 request over a tcp connection which was an inefficient then in 1.1 it allowed one stream to send multiple http requests 
- fun fact: back in the day when sessions was used to hit different servers using a load balancer which stored your session inside their cache which would revoke your session requesting a login 
- A connection is controlled at the transport layer, and therefore fundamentally out of scope for HTTP.
 HTTP doesn't require the underlying transport protocol to be connection-based; it only requires it to be reliable, or not lose messages (at minimum, presenting an error in such cases). Among the two most common transport protocols on the Internet, TCP is reliable and UDP isn't. HTTP therefore relies on the TCP standard, which is connection-based. 
- the enhancements of 1 and 1.1 will hopefully be explained later

#### DNS built over UDP

## Protocols

- Protocol is a set of rules which was defined to serve a purpose as a solution to the problem it was trying to solve

### Protocol properties (what disntincts each protocol from the other)

#### Data format
- Text based communication (Human Readable) JSON , XML, Txt
- Binary (portobuf, Resp, http2 , http3 http2 and 3 are text based in usage but the actual communication is done in binary format) 
#### Transfer Mode
- Message based (UDP,HTTP)
- Stream (TCP,WebRTC)
#### Addressing System
- DNS name, IP, MAC
#### Directionality
- Bidirectional TCP
- Unidirectional HTTP
- Full/Half duplex (Like the wifi)?

***Alright so there is a bit of inconsistency where when i studied the DNS i wrote it here but it was hussein i guess but its extra work in general so this md is transformed to extra work in general its knowledge here in my garage*** 

## DHCP
https://www.nwkings.com/dora-process-in-dhcp
https://www.nwkings.com/what-is-dhcp-in-networking

- Alright i spent mroe than needed on DHCP so lets start with the basics and explain the basics first
- I didnt write was waiting to create a drawing just for linkedIN which was a blockage rather than a motivation so fuck it ill write what i understood and fuck the drawing so i could go on
- So lets explain the DHCP first well first its built upon udp its not connection based it just broadcasts requests throughout the network
- its divided into 4 phases DORA

### Discovery
Discovery is a broadcast from the client sent throughout the network with ip address in the network layer of a mask with a mask or 255.255.255.255 i think means it goes to all ip addresses in the network coming from port 67 using udp targeted to a broadcast mac address FF.FF.FF.FF coming from a mac address specified whic is the client mac address specified for the 68 port of the server
### Offer
Offering is a broadcast in the network layer and and a unicast in the data link meaning i have the source and destination mac address since the client just sent me and its broadcasted to notify offers to other dhcp servers on the same network im not sure of that but one time ill build a dhcp server but fuck it rn not worth it maybe create a dhcp server on docker once i learn docker 
### Request
The client doesnt have an ip address yet but it knows the server ip address and its mac address so the client responds to the dhcp that sent it the first packet it recieved so thats called unicast in the data link layer since both mac addresses are know and it broadcasts the request again to show other dhcp servers that it is requesting ip addr xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 
### Accept
The DHCP recieves the request and saves it to its cache or table and lease time, etc. and it broadcast to the mac address it is again broadcasted in the network and unicasted in the data link giving the client its ip address and showing dhcp servers that my client has an ip addr of x. 

well my explanation is redundant and im repeating basically the same words and could be explained in just simple 4 lines so wouldnt look into it again unless ill create a docker dhcp server
## Dbus
- The Dbus is the abstraction interface provided by linux to all processes to share information between processes its how linux provides IPC to its processes
- DBUS has some things called bus names which are names assigned to processes for example the time date system process if taken by any one has a predefined bus name of org.system.timedate1 just to define a predefined interface of interacting with the service regardless of the application interacting with it or using it


### Masquerade
- didnt understand it really well couldnt understand idk why ill probably come back to it later

## OSI
- without a standard connection method you need to know the system youre talking to when sending a packet because it wouldve different for every medium and every system which isnt feasible but it doesnt make sense today because of the current standardization 
- standardization enables modularities in components, systems, etc. thats the beauty in it 

### Fucking Finally explained in a real life example
#### Sender Example (Sending a post request to and https webpage)
- Application layer ( POST request to the application server with a json packet)inside 
- Presentation Layer ( Then the JSON body or encoding is encoded and serialized into a string)
- Session Layer ( request tcp to establish a tcp connection and tls its responsible for the security and certificates and verifying sessions)
- Transport Layer (send the syn request and define source port and destination port specifying where should it go and how is it supposed to go resulting in a packet)
- Network Layer ( wrap the packet in source and destination ip address resulting in a segment)
- Data Link (turn the segment into a single frame and attach the source and destination mac address and the mask in case of a broadcast)
#### Reciever Example (Recieving the post request from the client)
- first the physical layer accepts the request
- Data link assembles back frame into a segment and decrypts the sourc ean ddest mac address
- the network layer assembles the segment into a ip packet
- the transport layer in case of syn request handles the control flow of packets handling the port assignements as well as retries, etc. for the syn request then but thats in general then sends it into the session layer to establish a connection with the client
- establishing the connection in the session layer and verifies sources and stops there in case of sync and then goes back through the same process to the client with the ack finally recieving the nexts sync then recieiving the packet and passing it up to the presentation layer
- decoding the incoming packet body and passes it to the application layer some people argue that the decoding is done by the application but yet that is what happens in the osi not the actual real world implementation (its just like things in the mirror dont appear as they seem) 
- finally the application understands the post request and the proper event is triggered in your application
#### components operating at specific layers 

- for example the switch operations stops only on the data link layer because it reroutes data inside the subnet subnet where it sees the source and destination mac address only and is what it needs to be able to reroute the connection
- As for the router it sees till the network layer which means it operates at the network layer because it needs to see the ip to be able to do its job because it reroutes the packets from a pirvate address to the public ip address
- And the firewall works till the transport layer because it needs to look till the ports becuase it has access to block requests coming from a given port, ip address, or a mac address
- The proxy works on the same layers as the firewall because it needs to read the ports and ip addresses to be able to reroute and assigns new source ip address to the same destination ip address 
- CDN, Load Balancer operate at the application layer it needs the applciation layer with the certificates and privelages of the server because they need to decrypt the message which in the cdn it needs it to cache it and for the load balancer it needs the laod so it can deliver it or distribute it on the servers

## Internet protocol

### IP address
- Layer 3 property (Network layer)
- The ip address contains info about the network and the host for example a.b.c.d/24 means that 24 bits or 3 bytes are taken up by the network and 8 bits or 1 byte is left for the host 192.168.254.0/24
#### subnets
- the subnet is that ip 192.168.254.0/24 which means the network inside is consisted of 255 network components ranging from 192.168.254.1 ~ 192.168.254.255
- the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 is used to define if the current ip address belong to the same subnet by using a bitwise and on the ip address and comparing the 2 ip addresses of the request determining if it needs rerouting out of the network or just use the only its mac address and communicate inside the same network
- for example 192.168.254.1 and 192.168.234.15 the host performs the and operation resulting in 192.168.254.0 for ip1 and 192.168.234.0 for ip2 resulting in a different subnet ip address or a different network address which means they dont belong to the same network
#### Default Gateway
- The default gateway is the a router which is one host considered as the link between 2 or more subnets where it has 2 or more interfaces one connected to the current network and the other to the outside network
- if 2 hosts has the same subnet then they dont need to be rerouted then they wont go up to the network layer theyll only reach the data link and use their mac addresses to communicate
- and if they dont belong to the same network the subnet checking operation is done to the other network and if not its sent to their default gateway checkcing as well again and so on till they reach the destination
- a tip said by him is that to not be under the router congestion's mercy is putboth the application and the database for example in the same subnet so they dont get affected by the router

#### IP Packet header components
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791
very good rfc link well structured explaining some of the core concepts i explained above as well as the ip packet structure
- the most important headers are the fragments identification which takes 2 bytes that aids in assembling the fragments.
- flag which take 3 bits the first bit is reserved the second is dont fragment which is may or dont fragment and the last is more fragments which indicates either last fragment or more fragment
- and the fragment offset taking 13 bits of the header indicates the offset of the sent fragment which is where does it belong inside the datagram
- the fragmentation is identified by the mtu of the reciever which is usually 15000 bytes which sends an ICMP message indicating that the sender must fragment and it cant pass
- TTL the maximum amount of hops the fragment or packet can make before dying (1 byte)
- and a checksum to check the validity of the data (2 bytes)
- and the source and destination address (4 bytes)

### ICMP
- ICMP is a stateless protocol which resides in the network layer works with ip packets needing no ports or listeners to recieve or send a packet only if the reciever has his ICMP enabled.
- why would someone disable ICMP? because since it needs no connection establishment it has no method 
- If ICMP is disabled sometimes it can lead to a TCP black hole because its waiting on a connection but the server cant respond with icmp informing the sender to fragment the packet so it keeps waiting and whenever it sends the same packet to the server it dooesnt get a response with the ICMP
- ICMP is used for pings, fragmentation needed message
- there is a clever trick using the ttl of the ip packet's headers is setting it to 1 and sending pinging the client and at each node or router it can return and icmp message from the reciever that the dest is unreachable and giving it its ip address and then increasing the ttl and forwarding it to the next router which is called a trace route

# 13-12-2024
- after understanding ip protocol as well as osi model the rest became much simpler to understand simply understanding the layers and visualizing how the packet goes through each layer 
## UDP
- UDP is a layer 4 protocol which uses ports to address porcesses inside host unlike ip addresses which addresses hosts only 
- stateless and needs no prior communication
- vpns uses udp and cant use tcp because there happens a tcp meltdown which is the cascading of fragmentation or failure
- there isnt that much to udp keep in mind that it isnt exposed it can be protected on dtls or normal tls
- even its headers are simple only contain length and source and destination port
- each process or each socket is uniquely identified by a file descriptor and most of what i learned is explained inside udp_server.c or tcp_server.c
- the cons of udp can be summed up to no congestion control and the protocol isnt reliable.
- there is a way of attacking using udp is dns flooding where spoofing their source ip address to be the address of the victim and talk to the dns server and the millions of requeset comes back to the victim basically killing it and as well as dosing dns servers but that would be hard but easy to perform.

## TCP
- tcp is a layer 4 protocol and it is a connection based protocol
- its stateful in the sense that it keeps track of each packet sent and its count as well as acknowledging which packet has arrived to its destination and which segment failed and retrying, etc.
- tcp is useful for any bidirectional communication
- the multiplexing in udp happens in tcp as well where the sender sends packets to the reciever multiplexed each has an identifying file descriptor and the reciever demultiplexes it using ports mapping to each process
- the defining file descriptor is hashed and saved into memory in the case of tcp because it wants to save the state to checkt the connection and mapping source(addr,port), dest(addr,port) to the memory identifying if it needs retransmission where to send etc. essentially the state of the connection is stored in there
- source port can accept any amount of connections and is only limited by the cpu and queue size or memory size essentially
- the ack is followed by a segment descriptor for example sending 3 segments and receiving only 2 segments an ack2 is sent back acknowledging only 2 are recieved while indicating that the third needs to be retransmitted
- the tcp connection is finally closed by using a fin and the server sends an acknowledgement and then the server sends a fin request and when the client sends the ack to the server finally the server can remove the file descriptor but as for the client it has to wait before removing the connection from its machine because of something called time wait is the time it should wait for packets that havent yet arrived to be coming at the old file descriptor so they dont get lost after closing the connection.
- four way fin handshake , time wait is the amount of time the client waits before removing the file descriptor from its memory after closing the connection

#### TCP headers
- the sequence number is the sequence number of the current segmetn which is only 4 bytes and if exceeded it resets its different from the acknowledgement number which also takes up 4 bytes because of the fact you can acknowledge past data segment and can send new segments in the same segment

## TLS
- tls lives on the session layer
- tls uses symmetric key to encrypt both the sent request and the recieved request its more efficient to use symmetric keys which it uses the same key to decryp t and encrypt the data sent on the network.
- now the idea is to send the symmetric key securely without being vulnerable for anyone to get it and this is tls i presume
- authenticating the server is done using ssl certificates which is verified by a certicate chain and asking trusted authors on the host
- to do so the tls uses public assymetric keys to send the symmetric key

### TLS 1.2 connection sequence
- first the client sends to the server a hello request
- the tls connection establishment uses the PKI (public key interface which we are using to send the symmetric key accross the client and the server)
- the server sends back with RSA public key a hello request alongside the certificate
- the client checks the certificate and sends back a change cipher with its symmetric key encrypted with the public key and the server decrypts it finally using its private key which was made for decoding
- and then sends the client that change cipher, fin request means keys exchanged and now you can encrypt http with the given key
- heartbleed by using openssl bug and server memory leaks to get the private keyand once you have the private key you can decrypt the backlog of requests and decrypt them all it
- that means its bad in forward secrecy some rules were done to generate the certificate and key every 2 weeks to ensure security as a coping mechanism
### TLS 1.3 Diffie Hellman instead of RSA
- the client creates a public and a private key and then sends the public key and the public key to the power of the private key to the server in a client hello request
- then the server responds with the public key raised to the private key of the server with a server hello request 
- now to get the symmetric key you will raise the server key to the private key of the client and raise the client key to the server private key

***what i understood and i might've understood it wrong is that the public keys are held by the certificates not entirely sure***

## HTTP
- [HTTP_1](#http-built-over-tcp)
- http 1 opens a new tcp connection with every request, cant be chunked as well.
- doesnt understand hosts only ip addresses no host header
### HTTP 1.1
- one persisted connection to send the http packets through it
- it is probably sequential where you send request and after recieving the response you send another request
- has HOL which means that if a segment fails all the other requests must wait for the packet to be retransmitted which is in the nature of tcp  
- another hol problem was that http1.1 used to pipeline requests but requests needed to come back in the same order so the rest of the packets coming afte rhte first heavy request must wait for it to finish first
- and pipelining which isnt used anymore is sending all requests at once and wait for their requests at once but the backend is responsible for maintaining order and ensuring that you are waiting for the first request which doesnt scale because it gets really complex and it always requires context with adding layers between the server and the client it gets even more complex.
- the browser utilized http 1.1 for each domain by opening 6 tcp connections and getting each element such as index.html and index.css, index.js supposedly each would be on its own tcp connection

### HTTP 2
- http2 sends gets all data in a stream for each element (multiplexing) and a unique identifier for each stream representing an element and it uses odd ids for stream identification which i dont know why its an odd number specifically 
- http2 gets really affected by the hol where each stream is independent but to the server it seems like they are all segments to the same component whihc is the poroperty of the tcp ocnnection so if index.html fails for example and it belonged to stream 1 instead of just resending the html and wait for it to be retransmitted and recieved so the other streams can resume 
- the juggling of streams is an extra work put on the server which means increased cpu usage.
- http2 was designed to solve the problem of sending 1 request per tcp connection (not sure of this)
