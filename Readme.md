# Turbo Spoon (Spoon fed docs covering several topics across dev but currently mainly ops)
Collection of what I've learned and the docs written to explain it acting as a long term repository instead of temporary ones I've created before

## Structure
Each Directory contains a topic with a readme that usually contains what I've learned along the way or what I've chose to write from what I've written (inconclusive for what I know )
```
/aws
	Readme.md
/Networks
	Readme.md
	tcp_server.c --> a tcp server written in c just to test my understanding about sockets and what they really are and file descriptors, etc.
	udp_server.c
/general_ITI --> A readme contains what I've written and documented during ITI of what I've learned contains some random information needs ot be properly segregated later
	Readme.md
/linux --> The least in terms of what is written since most of it was learned by doing instead of reading the docs extensibely and documenting that (needs some work which will be done later as well)
	Readme.md
```

# Future Work
- On hopes of making this repo as a conclusive reference for what I've learned along the way although some things may slip but i'll try to make it as conclusive as possible 
- Maybe adding references and using tools such as obsidian to help visualize and manage the docs
